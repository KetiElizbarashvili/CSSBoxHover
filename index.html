        <p>The person who creates an NFT can make it available for free, or more often, they charge for it.

            It’s the same as buying an original painting from a shop – and just like that painting, once you own an NFT, you can sell it!
            
            You can’t spend your physical pennies and pounds on them though…  </p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of cryptocurrency? This is how NFTs are bought.

            Cryptocurrency is digital money. You can’t physically see it like you can with your pocket money!
            
            However, cryptocurrency can be bought with money through a digital wallet.
            
            There are loads of different cryptocurrencies. You might have heard of Bitcoin which is a very popular one!
            
            Cryptocurrency can also be exchanged back into physical money. </p>
